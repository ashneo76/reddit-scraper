Added the CHANGELOG

2.00
----

Massive refactor. Everything before this works technically,
but is really bad and wrong. Most notable change architecturally is that
plugins now handle download tasks themselves (the BasePlugin class does)
instead of creating a huge list and doing it all as a secondary post process.
