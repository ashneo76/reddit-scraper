2.14
----
Fixed the upvote counter missing the first page.

2.13
----
Make partial successes fail gracefully when getting large numbers of upvote
pages all at once. So long as we got some response report a warning and make
due with what we got instead of throwing an exception and losing everything.

2.12
----
Change the API spec to be Reddit-ier. Now the output makes more sense and a
casual user will make more sense of what the class is doing (even though
before it was strictly conforming to the terminology in the API spec,
it's better to use the layman's vernacular, dog).

2.11
----
Add connection throttling to the `meth` get_liked() method in `class`
RedditConnect. If you request more than 30 pages, you now no longer get banned.

2.10
----
Add the ability to return cookies with the url from plugins
Make image header detection more flexible to things like included encoding
information
Convert all the plugins over to use BeautifulSoup4 (overdue)
Added a test for the plugin interface (more of these needed you lazy bastard!)
Tried to prune the successes a little better to reduce test run time in the
2.0 architecture

2.04
----
Restructure the BasePlugin class (PEP8 style)

2.03
----
Update the README

2.02
----
Added the CHANGELOG
Fix for md5 mismatches outputting "SUCCESS!" messages stupidly.

2.01
----
A bugfix for accidentally supressing the bad image header error message

2.00
----

Massive refactor. Everything before this works technically,
but is really bad and wrong. Most notable change architecturally is that
plugins now handle download tasks themselves (the BasePlugin class does)
instead of creating a huge list and doing it all as a secondary post process.
